# Multiplayer-FPS-Riptide-Example-
Multiplayer Example Using Riptide\
By Ruben Kwant

FPS multiplayer project I was working on a while ago (updated to Riptide 2.0).\
I am releasing this because I don't have much time to work on it anymore sadly.

Note: this project is on many parts unfinished, providing a basic playable state.

Features:\
-Player movement with basic client prediction, server reconciliation.\
-Player interpolation for other clients\
-Basic IK system (only used for player aim direction currently)\
-Level loading (server dictates which map the clients play on server start-up), server level changing can be added easily but it is not implemented yet.\
-Very basic system for different gametypes (TDM, DM and such).\
-Early stage of a weapon system (mostly visual only and you can't kill other players yet).\

How to Use it:
-Open Server Project\
-Load Main Scene\
-Press Play\

-Open Client Project\
-Load MainMenu Scene\
-Press Play\
-Click on Debug Connect\
Voilà!

If server discconect the client on first play (because client is taking time loading all the assets) just click "Debug Connect" again and Voilà
